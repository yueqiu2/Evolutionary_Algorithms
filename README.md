## 2.Optimization Problem Using Gradiant Descent with Nesterov Momention + Bayesian Optimization
- Derivative-free optimization
- Challenge: (1) function evaluation budgets; (2) high dimensionality; (3)non-convexity
- Low dimensionality case: 50 budgets, with 30 for BO, and 20 for gradient descent with Nesterov momentom
- High dimensionality case: all budgets for gradient descent with Nesterov momentom
- **Beat all 3 benchmarks (Nelder-Mead, Powell, COBYLA) in all test functions**

At the critical point, only one phase exists. The heat of vaporization is zero. There is a stationary inflection point in the constant-temperature line on a P-V diagram. At the critical point exists a mathematical relationship:

(Note: $T_{c}$ refers to critical temperature)

We fit the liquid phase density and the gas phase density at a certain pressure in the phase envelope through the neural network, and then combine the two curves of density variation with pressure to finally find the point of minimum density variation, which is the critical point, and the pressure corresponding to the critical point is the critical pressure.
